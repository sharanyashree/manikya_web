        <button class="faq-question">Q1. What is a Chit Fund? <span>+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            A chit fund is a traditional Indian financial scheme where a group of
            people contribute a fixed amount of money at regular intervals into a
            common pool. This pool is given to one member of the group each cycle—
            either through a bidding process or a lottery.
          </p>

          <p><strong>It is a savings-cum-borrowing system that allows members to:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Save regularly</li>
            <li>Access a lump sum of money when needed</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The chit fund continues until all members have received the pooled
            amount once.
          </p>

          <p>
            In simple terms, it’s a community-based method of managing both savings
            and credit—ideal for people who need funds without going to banks.
          </p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">2. What are the benefits of a Chit product? <span>+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
           <p>
      <strong>Dual Benefit – Saving & Borrowing</strong><br>
      Chits serve both as a saving tool and borrowing option, depending on when a
      member takes the prize money.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Regular Savings Habit</strong><br>
      Encourages disciplined, monthly savings, making it ideal for individuals
      looking to build financial stability.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Easy Access to Funds</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Subscribers can get a lump sum amount when needed—especially useful
        during emergencies, business needs, or large purchases.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Community-Based & Flexible</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Based on trust and mutual benefit among members. Also offers flexible
        bidding options for those who need early access to funds.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Low or No Interest Cost</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Members who win the bid early pay a discount, not interest—making it
        cheaper than traditional loans in many cases.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Better Returns for Late Winners</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Members who take the prize money later receive higher returns, as they
        continue to earn dividends from others’ bid discounts.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Regulated & Transparent</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Registered chit funds (like those governed by the Chit Funds Act, 1982)
        are legally recognized and regulated, ensuring safety and transparency.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">4. How do chit funds work? <span>+</span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
      A chit fund is a financial arrangement where a group of individuals
      (called subscribers) contribute a fixed amount of money every month
      for a set period. This money is collected into a common pool, and each
      month, one member receives the total amount through a bidding or
      lottery system.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Step-by-Step Process</strong></p>

    <p><strong>1. Formation of a Group</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A chit group is formed with a fixed number of members (e.g., 25 members
        for a 25-month chit).
      </li>
      <li>
        Each member agrees to contribute a fixed monthly amount.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>2. Monthly Contribution</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        All members contribute the agreed amount into a common pool each month.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>3. Auction or Lottery</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The total amount collected is given to one member every month:
      </li>
      <li>
        Through auction: Members bid to take a lower amount; the one with the
        lowest bid (i.e., highest discount) wins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Through lottery: If there’s no bidding, the winner is chosen randomly.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>4. Prize Money Distribution</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The winning member receives the net prize money (total collection minus
        the bid/discount and foreman commission).
      </li>
      <li>
        The discount is shared among the remaining members as a dividend.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>5. Cycle Repeats Every Month</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Each month, a new member wins the chit. The cycle continues until all
        members have received the prize amount once.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>25 members × ₹20,000 = ₹5,00,000 pool</li>
      <li>One member bids ₹4,20,000 → wins</li>
      <li>₹80,000 shared, commission deducted</li>
      <li>Foreman takes a small commission</li>
      <li>
        Process continues monthly until all 25 members get their turn.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
    <p>
      A chit fund works like a rotating savings and credit group, helping people
      save monthly and also get access to a large sum when needed—without
      interest and with community benefit.
